# Mask R-CNN in PyTorch 1.0

This project aims at providing the necessary building blocks for easily
creating detection and segmentation models using PyTorch 1.0.

Refer to https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark

## Installation

### Requirements:
- PyTorch 1.0 from a nightly release. It **will not** work with 1.0 nor 1.0.1. Installation instructions can be found in https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
- torchvision from master
- cocoapi
- yacs
- matplotlib
- GCC >= 4.9
- (optional) OpenCV for the webcam demo

```bash
# first, make sure that your conda is setup properly with the right environment
# for that, check that `which conda`, `which pip` and `which python` points to the
# right path. From a clean conda env, this is what you need to do

conda create --name maskrcnn_benchmark
conda activate maskrcnn_benchmark

# this installs the right pip and dependencies for the fresh python
conda install ipython

# maskrcnn_benchmark and coco api dependencies
pip install ninja yacs cython matplotlib tqdm

# follow PyTorch installation in https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# we give the instructions for CUDA 9.0
conda install -c pytorch pytorch-nightly torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 
pip install opencv-python

export INSTALL_DIR=$PWD

# install pycocotools
cd $INSTALL_DIR
git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git
cd cocoapi/PythonAPI
python setup.py build_ext install

# install PyTorch Detection
cd $INSTALL_DIR
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark.git
cd maskrcnn-benchmark

# the following will install the lib with
# symbolic links, so that you can modify
# the files if you want and won't need to
# re-build it
python setup.py build develop


unset INSTALL_DIR
```
## Demo

Download the pretrain models [here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IBKBHT0o_3unCWuoFe4JP7LdMaazU3qw)
Then, create a folder, '/pretrain' and put the pretrain models inside the folder.  

```bash
cd demo
python demo.py
```
